# Future of Coding Assignment 

### Which tools and model(s) you used:

#### general conversational assistant:
- ChatGPT
#### coding-specific assistant:
- Claude AI

### Which areas the tools struggled with and excelled at:
ChatGPT: Good at answering general questions and summarising with information search however, not efficient with specific code refactoring. 
Claude: performed well when asked to refactor and enhance specific code.

### Comparison of the code generation abilities of general assistants vs. coding-specific: 

The main comparison is that ChatGPT can't code without proper context while Claude-AI a programming-specific assistant can.
Claude-AI successfully refactored the code to enhance performance by reducing unnecessary operations.

### Recommendations for fellow students/developers on how to get the most out of the tools:

AI tools can be very helpful tools to reduce your time and effort in solving problems but it is better to use them as a learning tool without neglecting the human touch and judgment because these tools don't always produce perfect solutions.


# Programming as Theory:

### 1. How have your thoughts on "programming as theory" changed?
Understanding the underlying theory of the problem being solved and the theoretical aspects can enhance the ability to effectively solve the problem. 

### 2. Does programming require this deeper connection between the real world and the program code?
YES, understanding the real world can lead to more efficient and effective code solutions. A deep understanding can us generate more adaptable code that can survive longer when the world (requirements) change or evolve.

### 3. Do you feel the same about the most important skills for programmers to have?
Yes, understanding the world and problem conception can help programmers create solutions that are not only functional but also flexible and adaptable.

### 4. How do you envision the future of coding?
The increased use of AI code assistance is expected. The programmer's role will be to theorize and conceptualize the problem context whereas AI tools can do the rest.
